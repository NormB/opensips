/*
 * nats_rl.h -- one-per-interval log gate [P3.7].
 *
 * The outage logging policy across the NATS modules: a state that
 * repeats per call (broker down, payload dropped, buffer truncated)
 * logs a rate-limited WARN plus a per-call DBG, instead of either a
 * WARN flood (nats_consumer's old per-request disconnect WARN) or
 * production invisibility (cachedb_nats's 13 DBG-only fast-fail
 * sites).  Usage:
 *
 *     static time_t rl;   // one slot per site (or shared per policy)
 *     if (nats_rl_pass(&rl, time(NULL), 30))
 *         LM_WARN("... (repeats suppressed for 30s)\n");
 *     LM_DBG("...\n");
 *
 * Slots are process-local; per-process emission is the intent (each
 * worker names itself in the log prefix).  Not thread-safe by design:
 * the only cost of a racing pass is one extra WARN line.  Contract is
 * unit-locked in lib/nats/tests/test_rl.c.

/**
 * One-per-interval log gate: decide whether this site may emit now.
 *
 * Returns 1 when the caller may emit (and stamps *last = now),
 * 0 when the site is inside its quiet interval.  interval_s <= 0
 * disables limiting.  A clock that jumps backwards re-arms the gate
 * (re-stamping to the new now) instead of silencing the site until
 * wall time catches back up to the stale stamp.
 *
 * @param last       Per-site slot, caller-owned (typically a function-
 *                   local static, so process-local).  Stamped to @now on
 *                   an emitting pass; nothing is allocated, no one frees.
 * @param now        Current wall time (the caller's time(NULL)).
 * @param interval_s Quiet interval in seconds; <= 0 disables limiting
 *                   (returns 1 without stamping *last).
 *
 * @return 1 = caller may emit (slot stamped), 0 = suppressed.
 *
 * Locking: none; plain non-atomic read/write of *last.  Not thread-safe
 * by design (see the file comment): a racing pass costs one extra line.
 *
 * Context: any process or thread (SIP worker, cnats callback thread,
 * MI handler, timer proc); slots are process-local, so each process
 * gates independently.
