 * nats_validate_publish_subject() contract test.
 *
 * History: the validator briefly carried a per-thread (pointer, length,
 * result) cache to skip re-scanning identical script-supplied subject
 * literals.  That cache was a security hole: OpenSIPS reuses pkg and
 * static str buffers at the same address across script invocations, so a
 * buffer that once held a valid subject could be refilled with
 * same-length attacker-influenced SIP data containing CRLF / wildcards /
 * spaces and be served a stale "valid" verdict — letting control bytes
 * reach the line-oriented NATS wire protocol (protocol injection via
 * "PUB <subject>\r\n").  The cache was removed; this test pins the
 * contract so it cannot come back.
 *
 * BDD contract asserted here:
 *   GIVEN any buffer, WHEN its contents change between calls — even at
 *   the same address with the same length — THEN the validator returns
 *   the verdict for the *current bytes*, never a remembered one.
 *
 * Plus the original correctness assertions: repeated validation,
 * alternation between subjects, prefix lengths, and NULL/zero-length.
 *
 * Build:
 *   gcc -g -O0 -fsanitize=address -Wall -I.. \
 *       -o test_validate_subject_cache test_validate_subject_cache.c \
 *       ../nats_validate.o
