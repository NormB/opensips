/**
 * Copy an OpenSIPS str into a caller-provided fixed buffer, NUL-terminating.
 *
 * Guards a negative s->len: it is an int, and the (size_t) cast in the bounds
 * check below would turn a negative value into a huge positive one, silently
 * passing the check and causing a massive memcpy.  A NULL/empty str yields an
 * empty C string.  An embedded NUL is rejected (see the body comment: the
 * result feeds C-string NATS key/subject APIs, which would truncate).
 *
 * @param s        Source str; NULL, NULL s->s or len == 0 yields "".
 * @param buf      Destination buffer, caller-owned (stack/pkg/shm -- the
 *                 caller's choice; nothing is allocated here).
 * @param buf_size Capacity of @buf in bytes, including the NUL; 0 is
 *                 rejected (even "" needs one byte).
 *
 * @return 0 on success (@buf NUL-terminated), -1 on a zero-capacity
 *         buffer, negative length, overflow (s->len >= buf_size) or
 *         embedded NUL; @buf is left untouched on -1.
 *
 * Locking: none.
 * Context: any process or thread; logs via LM_ERR on rejection.
