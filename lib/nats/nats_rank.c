/**
 * @file nats_rank.c
 * @brief OpenSIPS process-rank admission rule for NATS init.
 *
 * Placed in its own translation unit (rather than inlined in nats_pool.c)
 * so that unit tests can link it without dragging in the rest of the pool
 * and its OpenSIPS core dependencies (shm, logging, nats.c).  The function
 * is the single source of truth for the admission rule; both event_nats
 * and cachedb_nats call it from their mod_child_init.

	 *   - SIP workers (UDP + TCP, rank >= 1): route-driven events + KV ops.
	 *   - PROC_MODULE (HTTPD/MI): script/MI-driven publishes.
	 *   - PROC_TIMER: the OpenSIPS timer process raises a large class of
	 *     subscribable events SYNCHRONOUSLY in-process -- usrloc contact/AoR
	 *     EXPIRY (E_UL_CONTACT_EXPIRED ...), dialog timeouts, tm timers.
	 *     event_nats' raise callback runs in whatever process fires the
	 *     event, so without a connection here every timer-raised NATS
	 *     publish is dropped and mis-counted as a transient failure.  Many
	 *     of the module's headline events (registration/dialog lifecycle)
	 *     are timer-driven, so the timer MUST initialize.
	 * Everything else (attendant PROC_MAIN, PROC_TCP_MAIN, module-exported
	 * forks like the consumer/watcher procs) either does not raise events or
	 * has its own explicit initialization path.
