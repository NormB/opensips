 * Fetches the connected URL via @get_url and redacts any "user[:pass]@"

 * (mi_nats_status) — the raw URL can carry the broker password.  Any
 * failure — no connection, no getter, non-OK getter status, no output
 * buffer — degrades to the literal "not connected"; the getter's buffer
 * content is never trusted on a non-OK return (GetConnectedUrl may
 * leave it unterminated).
 *
 * @param nc      Connection handle; only passed through to @get_url.
 *                NULL means not connected.
 * @param get_url URL getter (production: the nats_dl
 *                natsConnection_GetConnectedUrl pointer).  NULL is
 *                tolerated and reads as not connected.
 * @param out     Destination buffer, caller-owned (typically the
 *                caller's static); nothing is allocated.
 * @param out_sz  Capacity of @out in bytes; 0 reads as not connected.
 *
 * @return @out (NUL-terminated, redacted, truncated if needed) on
 *         success; the static literal "not connected" otherwise.  The
 *         caller must not write through the returned pointer.
 *
 * Locking: none.
 * Context: any process; no broker I/O beyond the injected getter.
