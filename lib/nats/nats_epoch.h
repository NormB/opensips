/*
 * nats_epoch.h -- the epoch-tagged handle idiom [P2.8], in ONE place.
 *
 * The pool bumps a per-process reconnect epoch from the libnats
 * reconnect callback.  Any handle DERIVED from the connection (KV
 * store, JetStream context, subscription, in-flight RPC) is dead
 * weight after a reconnect; consumers tag the handle with the epoch
 * at acquire time and re-acquire when the tag goes stale.  This
 * header replaces the save/compare/refresh dance that used to be
 * re-implemented at every site.
 *
 * THE TRAP this header exists to encode (it was P0.1, a permanent
 * per-worker outage): on a REFRESH path, snapshot the epoch BEFORE
 * acquiring the new handle and adopt the snapshot only AFTER the
 * acquire succeeds.  Re-reading the epoch at adopt time can pair an
 * OLD-connection handle with a NEW epoch tag -- the staleness check
 * then never fires again until the next reconnect.  Snapshot-first is
 * conservative in the benign direction: a reconnect that lands mid-
 * refresh leaves the tag stale, so the next call refreshes again.
 *
 *   acquire:   nats_epoch_save(&h->epoch);          (with the handle)
 *   fast path: if (nats_epoch_current(&h->epoch) && h->kv) use it;
 *   refresh:   int snap = nats_epoch_snapshot();
 *              h->kv = nats_pool_get_kv(...);
 *              if (h->kv) nats_epoch_adopt(&h->epoch, snap);
 *   liveness:  nats_epoch_lost(&h->epoch)  ==  reconnected OR
 *              currently disconnected (the "did we lose the broker
 *              since this started" test for in-flight work).
 *
 * Self-contained: only the two pool accessors are declared here, so
 * SHM-struct headers (e.g. nats_rpc_slot.h) can embed nats_epoch_t
 * without pulling the whole pool surface.
