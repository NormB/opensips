/**
 * Parse a semicolon-separated k=v config string into a freshly-allocated
 * SHM handle.  Unknown keys are rejected as config errors.
 *
 * @param config_str  Bind-parameter string; borrowed for the duration of
 *                    the call (the parser copies what it keeps).  NULL /
 *                    empty is a parse error.
 * @param err         Optional error out-parameter; may be NULL.  On
 *                    failure set to a borrowed static string describing
 *                    the first error -- must NOT be freed.  Reset to NULL
 *                    on entry.
 * @return            New handle on success; NULL on parse / validation /
 *                    allocation failure (any partially-built handle is
 *                    freed internally before returning).
 *
 * Allocation: the handle and every str field inside it are shm_malloc'd.
 * The CALLER owns the result -- either transfer ownership with
 * nats_registry_bind() (which takes it on rc == 0) or release it with
 * nats_handle_free().
 *
 * Locking: none taken.
 *
 * Context: any process; real callers are mod_init (pre-fork, `bind`
 * modparam), the startup-route script bind and the MI bind handler.
