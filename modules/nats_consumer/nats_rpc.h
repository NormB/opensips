 * nats_rpc.h -- script-callable NATS headers + reply-to + RPC.
 *
 * Entry points:
 *
 *   $nats_hdr(Name)           -- pseudo-var; reads a header from the
 *                                current message (populated by
 *                                nats_fetch / nats_fetch_batch +
 *                                nats_batch_select).  Case-insensitive
 *                                lookup, returns NULL on miss.
 *
 *   nats_hdr_set(name, value) -- stage a (name, value) pair onto the
 *                                per-worker outbound header buffer.
 *                                Replaces a staged entry with the same
 *                                name.  Cleared automatically after the
 *                                next outbound publish (nats_reply /
 *                                nats_request), even on publish failure.
 *
 *   nats_reply(payload)       -- publish `payload` on the current
 *                                message's reply subject.  Plain core
 *                                NATS publish (not JetStream); attaches
 *                                any staged headers.  Returns
 *                                -1 no current message,
 *                                -2 no reply-to on the current message,
 *                                -3 NATS connection unavailable,
 *                                -4 publish failed,
 *                                 1 on success.
 *
 *   nats_request(subj, payload, timeout_ms) -- core NATS RPC
 *                                request/reply.  Two call shapes:
 *                                  bare nats_request(...)            -- sync
 *                                  async(nats_request(...), rt)      -- async
 *                                The sync shape blocks the worker for
 *                                up to timeout_ms; the async shape
 *                                yields to the reactor on a per-call
 *                                worker-private timerfd while the
 *                                consumer process publishes the
 *                                request and awaits the reply on its
 *                                persistent inbox subscription.  On
 *                                success the reply populates the
 *                                per-worker current-message state so
 *                                the script can read $nats_data,
 *                                $nats_subject, $nats_hdr(...), etc.
 *                                Return codes (no path returns 0;
 *                                see action.c:196 -- a 0 return from
