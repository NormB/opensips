/*
 * nats_rpc_slot.h -- per-call SHM slot table for the
 * consumer-process-routed async nats_request transport.
 *
 * Why SHM
 *   An earlier per-worker subscription transport segfaulted
 *   because libnats's async-callback subscription thread is
 *   incompatible with the SIP UDP worker context.  This design
 *   moves the subscription to the consumer process (the only
 *   context that already runs libnats safely) and hands off
 *   in-flight state between worker and consumer via SHM.
 *
 * Wake mechanism (IPC wake + worker-private guard timerfd) [P3.1]
 *   OpenSIPS's reactor cannot register fork-inherited eventfds
 *   (see commit 8eae39a5b1).  Instead, each async call creates a
 *   fresh worker-private timerfd registered with the reactor, and
 *   the resume function reads the slot's atomic state whenever it
 *   fires.  When the consumer transitions the slot to DELIVERED
 *   (or abandons it) it IPC-signals the claiming worker
 *   (slot->owner_proc) via nats_rpc_wake_send(); the worker-side
 *   handler pokes the call's timerfd to fire immediately, so the
 *   reply resumes at wire latency.  The timer's own coarse tick
 *   (async_rpc_poll_ms, default 100 ms) only bounds how late a
 *   lost wake or a timeout is noticed.
 *
 * State machine
 *
 *     FREE  -- slot is idle, may be claimed by a worker
 *     CLAIMED -- worker has CAS'd the slot, is filling out_*
 *     INFLIGHT -- worker has IPC'd to consumer, awaiting reply
 *     DELIVERING -- consumer has pinned the claim (CAS from
 *                  INFLIGHT) and is writing reply_*; while pinned
 *                  the worker treats the slot as not-ready and
 *                  never abandons/frees it
 *     DELIVERED -- consumer finished writing reply_* and published
 *                  the reply (store from DELIVERING)
 *     ABANDONED -- worker resume timed out; consumer must drop
 *                  any late reply landing on this slot_idx
 *
 *   FREE ->CLAIMED is a CAS by the worker; the consumer's
 *   INFLIGHT -> DELIVERING -> DELIVERED sequence is a claim-pin
 *   (only the consumer transitions out of DELIVERING).  Every other
 *   transition is done with the slot owned exclusively by either
 *   the worker or the consumer.  No mutex is needed because each
 *   role only reads the other's fields after observing the state
 *   transition that publishes them (acquire/release pairing).
