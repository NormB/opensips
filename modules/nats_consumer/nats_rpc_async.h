 * nats_rpc_async.h -- internal API of the async nats_request path.
 *
 * The async entry point itself (w_nats_request_async) is declared
 * in nats_rpc.h alongside the rest of the script-callable RPC
 * surface; that's the only symbol nats_consumer.c needs.  This
 * header exposes the state-machine primitives so the in-flight
 * unit test (test_async_request_inflight.c) can drive them in
 * isolation without linking libnats.
 *
 * All functions are process-local (per-worker); the in-flight
 * table is statically sized in nats_rpc_async.c and is not shared
 * across processes.
