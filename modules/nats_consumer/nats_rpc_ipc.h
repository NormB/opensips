 * nats_rpc_ipc.h -- worker -> consumer-process publish hop for the
 * consumer-process-routed async nats_request transport.
 *
 * [P2.1] This hop rides OpenSIPS core IPC: the SIP worker calls
 * ipc_send_rpc(<consumer proc>, nats_rpc_ipc_on_publish, param) and the
 * whole payload -- {slot_idx u32, generation u32} -- is packed INTO the
 * opaque param pointer (zero allocation; the pipe is the queue).  The
 * consumer process pumps its IPC fd from the main loop, gated on a live
 * broker connection, so entries wait in the pipe across reconnects
 * exactly like they used to wait in the SHM ring.
 *
 * The generation captured at send time lets the consumer reject a stale
 * entry whose slot was freed and re-claimed before the pump
 * (nats_rpc_slot_entry_is_current -- prevents a double-publish).
 * Producers transition the slot CLAIMED -> INFLIGHT via
 * nats_rpc_slot_publish() BEFORE sending.
 *
 * If the send fails (pipe full / consumer proc not yet up) the producer
 * sees -1 and surfaces -5 (capacity exhausted) to the script -- the
 * same fail-fast contract as the old bounded SHM queue.
 *
 * The pack/unpack pair is unit-locked in tests/test_rpc_ipc_pack.c.
