 * @return  1  success -- the ack was enqueued to the consumer process.
 *         -1  no current message (nothing fetched, or already finalized).
 *         -2  consumer process not up, IPC pipe refused the send, or (for
 *             nak_delay) SHM exhaustion; the message stays un-acked and
 *             JetStream redelivers after ack_wait.

 * Allocation: none on the hot path -- the 64-bit ack token travels packed
 * in the opaque ipc_send_rpc param.  Exception: w_nats_nak_delay
 * shm_malloc's a small nats_ack_nak_delay_t payload; the consumer-side
 * handler frees it (the sender frees it itself if the send is refused).
 *
 * Locking: none.  Only per-worker static state (the current-message /
 * batch buffers in nats_fetch.c) is consulted.
 *
 * Context: SIP worker script context (cmd_export, ALL_ROUTES).  On rc 1,
 * ack / nak / nak_delay / term / ack_next clear the current-message state
 * (and invalidate the selected batch slot) so a second call returns -1
 * instead of double-acking; in_progress / ack_progress deliberately keep
 * it, since the worker still intends to ack or nak later.
