 * nats_rpc_wake.h -- consumer -> worker reply wake for the async
 * nats_request transport.
 *
 * [P3.1] Without this hop the worker learns of a DELIVERED reply only
 * on the next tick of its per-call guard timerfd, so reply latency is
 * floored at the poll interval and every in-flight call costs periodic
 * timer wakeups.  Instead, the consumer process signals the claiming
 * worker the moment it publishes the reply:
 *
 *   ipc_send_rpc(slot->owner_proc, nats_rpc_async_on_wake,
 *                nats_rpc_ipc_pack(slot_idx, generation));
 *
 * and the worker-side handler pokes the call's guard timerfd to fire
 * immediately (preserving its periodic interval).  The reactor then
 * runs the normal resume function, which reads the slot state -- ALL
 * completion logic stays in resume_nats_request_slot; the wake is
 * purely an accelerator.  A lost or refused wake is harmless: the
 * coarse guard tick picks the reply up as before.
 *
 * The per-worker registry maps slot_idx -> (generation, timerfd) for
 * this worker's in-flight calls.  It is strictly process-local and
 * single-threaded: register/unregister run on the worker main thread
 * (script context) and on_wake runs on the same thread (reactor IPC
 * pump), so no locking is needed.  A wake whose generation does not
 * match the registered entry is a stale signal for a previous claim of
 * the slot and is dropped -- it must never poke another call's timer.
 *
 * The send side runs in the consumer process; calling ipc_send_rpc
 * from the libnats reply thread follows the established event_nats
 * pattern (ipc_dispatch_rpc from the subscription callback).
