 * nats_rpc_consumer.h -- consumer-process side of the
 * consumer-process-routed async nats_request transport.
 *
 * All three functions below are called from the dedicated
 * nats_consumer process (not from SIP workers).  They set up a
 * persistent libnats subscription on
 * `_INBOX.opensips.<consumer_pid>.>`, drain the worker -> consumer
 * IPC queue and publish for each entry, and on each reply land
 * the payload into the corresponding SHM slot and store its state
 * DELIVERED; the worker observes it on its next private-timerfd poll
 * (no fd is signalled).
 *
 * The libnats subscription callback runs on a libnats internal
 * thread inside the consumer process.  That context is known
 * safe for libnats threading (it's the same place where
 * JetStream pull subscriptions live today); the earlier
 * worker-side subscription pattern -- which crashed -- is gone.

/**
 * Set up the persistent inbox subscription against the consumer
 * process's libnats connection.  Idempotent: returns 0 immediately if
 * already subscribed.
 *
 * The wildcard subscribed to is
 * `_INBOX.opensips.<consumer_pid>.>`; each in-flight publish
 * sets reply-to to `_INBOX.opensips.<consumer_pid>.<slot_idx>`
 * so the callback can look the slot up in O(1) without a hash.
 *
 * @return  0 on success (or already subscribed), -1 on subscribe
 *          failure (pool down, permission denied, prefix overflow).
 *          Non-fatal: the consumer continues doing JetStream pull work;
 *          while the inbox is down, the async-request publish path
 *          abandons every call and the script sees a failure code.
 *
 * Allocation: the natsSubscription is created and owned by libnats;
 * stored in a process-local static and released only by
 * nats_rpc_consumer_unsubscribe().  No locking.
 *
 * Context: consumer process main loop ONLY -- once at startup, then
 * retried each tick while nats_rpc_consumer_inbox_ready() is 0.
