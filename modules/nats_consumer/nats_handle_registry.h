 * nats_handle_registry -- SHM-backed hash table of consumer handles.
 *
 * The registry is the single source of truth for bound JetStream consumer
 * configurations.  Handles are added/removed at runtime via the MI bind/
 * unbind commands or script functions.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   - Lookups (hot path) take a per-bucket read lock.
 *   - Bind/unbind take the matching bucket write lock; the global rwlock
 *     is taken only for registry-wide iteration and teardown.
 *   - The runtime counters block inside each handle is guarded by a
 *     per-handle rwlock; stats updates do not block lookups.
 *
 * Memory:
 *   - All handle allocations live in SHM.  Callers transfer ownership
 *     to the registry via nats_registry_bind().
