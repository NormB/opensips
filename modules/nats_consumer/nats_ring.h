 * nats_ring.h -- per-handle multi-producer / multi-consumer SHM ring.
 *
 * A fixed-capacity bounded queue used to hand JetStream messages from the
 * single consumer process (producer side) to multiple OpenSIPS SIP worker
 * processes (consumer side).  Producers and consumers live in separate
 * OS processes; the ring and its metadata are therefore allocated from
 * OpenSIPS shared memory and all synchronization is done with plain C11
 * atomics.  A SHM-resident futex word (wake_seq) is bumped on the empty
 * -> non-empty edge so that a worker blocked in nats_ring_wait() is woken
 * up exactly once per batch.  There is deliberately no eventfd: a
 * per-process fd stored in SHM would be written/closed by processes other
 * than its creator (the producer runs in the consumer process), where the
 * integer maps to an unrelated descriptor.
 *
 * The ring stores messages by value (fixed-size slots); there are no
 * SHM allocations on the hot path.
