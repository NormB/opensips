/*
 * nats_rpc_subject.h -- reply-inbox subject grammar for the
 * consumer-process-routed async nats_request transport.
 *
 *     "<prefix>.<slot_idx>.<generation>.<corr_id>"
 *
 * The trailing <slot_idx>.<generation>.<corr_id> triple is how the
 * consumer's libnats reply callback correlates a reply to its SHM slot
 * without a hash table, AND authenticates it:
 *
 *   - <slot_idx>   locates the slot in O(1).
 *   - <generation> guards against a late reply landing on a slot that has
 *     since been freed and re-claimed by a *different* request (a
 *     cross-call data leak).  slot_idx and generation are both small and
 *     guessable, so on their own they do not authenticate the sender.
 *   - <corr_id> is the per-call UUIDv7 (74 bits of entropy).  Because the
 *     reply subject lives under a shared "<prefix>.>" wildcard that any
 *     broker peer can publish to, a peer who guesses slot_idx and
 *     generation could otherwise inject a forged reply.  on_inbox_reply
 *     requires the <corr_id> token to match the slot's stored corr_id, so
 *     a forged reply that does not know the UUID is rejected.  The
 *     corr_id is a single NATS token (hex + hyphens, no dots).
 *
 * Both functions are pure (no libnats / OpenSIPS dependencies) so they
 * can be unit-tested standalone -- see tests/test_rpc_subject.c.
