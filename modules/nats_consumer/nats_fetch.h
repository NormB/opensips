/*
 * nats_fetch.h -- script-callable fetch functions and per-worker
 * current-message state.
 *
 * The per-worker `nats_cur_msg_t` is module-global (static in
 * nats_fetch.c).  OpenSIPS SIP workers are single-threaded processes,
 * so a plain static gives us thread-local semantics without the
 * __thread keyword.  A fetch populates it; subsequent ack/nak/pvar
 * reads consume it.
 *
 * Single-message fetch exposes two entry points:
 *   - w_nats_fetch          (sync, cmd_export)
 *   - w_nats_fetch_async    (async, acmd_export with async_ctx)
 *
 * Batch fetch (w_nats_fetch_batch / _async) is declared below.
