/*
 * nats_mi.h -- MI command declarations for the nats_consumer registry.
 *
 * Shared contract (every handler below):
 *
 * @param params  MI arguments; owned by the MI core, read-only here.
 * @param async   asynchronous-MI handle; unused (all these commands
 *                answer synchronously) and may be NULL.
 * @return        a pkg-allocated mi_response_t (init_mi_result_object /
 *                init_mi_error); ownership transfers to the MI core,
 *                which serializes and frees it (free_mi_response).
 *                NULL = allocation failure (the core answers 500).
 *
 * Process/locking context: callable from whichever process runs the MI
 * core (attendant / MI process).  Safe there by construction: the
 * handle registry, SHM rings, ack/RPC IPC queues and the slot pool are
 * allocated pre-fork in SHM, per-handle counters are C11 atomics, and
 * registry mutations below take the registry lock.  No broker I/O is
 * performed by any of these handlers.
