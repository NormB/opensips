 * Regression test: the worker->consumer async-RPC IPC entry used to
 * carry only the slot index.  The consumer's publish_cb looked the slot
 * up and published it whenever its state was INFLIGHT.  That is unsafe
 * under slot reuse:
 *
 *   1. Worker A claims slot S (generation G), publishes (state INFLIGHT),
 *      and enqueues an IPC entry {slot_idx = S}.
 *   2. Worker A times out, abandons, and FREEs slot S before the consumer
 *      drains the IPC.
 *   3. Worker B claims slot S (generation G+1), publishes (INFLIGHT), and
 *      enqueues {slot_idx = S}.
 *   4. The consumer drains BOTH entries.  Both see slot S in INFLIGHT, so
 *      publish_cb publishes B's request TWICE -- a duplicate RPC.
 *
 * The fix tags each IPC entry with the slot's generation at enqueue and
 * has publish_cb skip an entry whose generation no longer matches the
 * slot's current claim (nats_rpc_slot_entry_is_current()).  Then A's
 * stale entry (gen G) is dropped and only B's entry (gen G+1) publishes.
 *
 * This test drives the REAL slot API (../nats_rpc_slot.c under the SHM
 * shim) and is compiled with -DNATS_RPC_SLOT_COUNT=1 so claim() always
 * returns the same slot, forcing the reuse the bug needs.  The consumer
 * drain decision is modelled by would_publish():
 *
 *   -DSIMULATE_PREFIX_BUG -> state-only check (pre-fix): publishes BOTH
 *                            entries -> the count==1 assertion FAILS.
 *   (default)             -> nats_rpc_slot_entry_is_current(): publishes
 *                            only the current entry -> ALL PASS.
 *
 * Build: TEST_SHIM + ../nats_rpc_slot.c, -DNATS_RPC_SLOT_COUNT=1.
