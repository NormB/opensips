 * nats_ring.c -- per-handle bounded MPMC SHM ring.
 *
 * Algorithm: bounded MPMC ring with per-slot generation tags.
 * Two monotonically-increasing 64-bit indices (head and
 * tail) live in the ring header; a power-of-two capacity means the
 * actual slot index is `head & mask`.  Per-slot sequence counters
 * (ready_gen / consumed_gen) decide when a producer may write a slot
 * and when a consumer may read it.
 *
 * Push (producer):
 *   1. Load head, tail.  If head - tail >= capacity the ring is full.
 *   2. Before committing the reservation, wait until the slot's
 *      consumed_gen has caught up to the previous generation
 *      (head - capacity) so we know the slot is no longer in use by a
 *      consumer.  The very first `capacity` pushes skip this test
 *      because the slot has never been used.
 *   3. CAS head from h to h+1.  On failure, retry from (1).
 *   4. Copy payload into slots[h & mask].
 *   5. Release-store slot->ready_gen = h.  This publishes the slot.
 *   6. If the pre-push head equaled tail (i.e. the ring was empty),
 *      bump wake_seq and FUTEX_WAKE waiters.  This is the empty ->
 *      non-empty edge.
 *
 * Pop (consumer):
 *   1. Load tail, head.  If tail >= head the ring is empty.
 *   2. Acquire-load slots[tail & mask].ready_gen.  If != tail the
 *      producer hasn't published yet; cpu_relax and retry the load,
 *      but re-check head first so a concurrent consumer that has
 *      advanced tail doesn't leave us spinning forever.
 *   3. CAS tail from t to t+1.  On failure, retry from (1).
 *   4. Copy slot contents into the caller's out buffer.
 *   5. Store slot->consumed_gen = t.  This releases the slot for the
 *      next producer generation.
 *
 * Wakeup is futex-only: the producer bumps wake_seq and FUTEX_WAKEs on
 * the empty -> non-empty transition, and the consumer is expected to
 * drain everything available after wake-up.  Spurious wakes are
 * harmless -- a subsequent pop just returns -1 and the worker re-arms
 * its wait.  There is no eventfd: a per-process fd stored in SHM would
 * be written/closed by processes other than its creator, where the
 * integer maps to an unrelated descriptor.
 *
 * Memory model: all shared indices use C11 _Atomic with explicit
 * memory_order annotations.  The release/acquire pair on ready_gen
 * synchronizes the payload write with the payload read; head and
 * tail advance with memory_order_acq_rel so the CAS is a full
 * barrier for the reservation itself.
