 * event_nats.h — Event Interface (EVI) transport for NATS
 *
 * Module:  event_nats
 *
 * Defines the transport identity constants used to register event_nats
 * as an EVI transport with the OpenSIPS event interface.  These constants
 * are referenced during module initialization (mod_init) when calling
 * evi_publish_event() and in the transport match/parse callbacks.
 *
 * Key constants:
 *   NATS_NAME         — transport protocol name string ("nats")
 *   NATS_STR          — str struct initializer for NATS_NAME
 *   NATS_FLAG         — unique bit flag identifying this transport
 *   NATS_DEFAULT_URL  — fallback NATS server URL
