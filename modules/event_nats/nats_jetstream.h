 *   nats_stream_info       — detailed stream metadata
 *   nats_stream_create     — create a new stream
 *   nats_stream_delete     — delete a stream
 *   nats_stream_purge      — purge all messages in a stream
 *   nats_consumer_list     — list consumers for a stream
 *   nats_consumer_info     — detailed consumer metadata
 *   nats_consumer_create   — create a consumer
 *   nats_consumer_delete   — delete a consumer
 *   nats_msg_get           — get a message by sequence number
 *   nats_msg_delete        — delete a message by sequence number

/*
 * Shared contract (every handler below):
 *
 * @param params     MI arguments (stream/consumer names, sequence
 *                   numbers); owned by the MI core, read-only here.
 *                   Names are validated before any broker call.
 * @param async_hdl  asynchronous-MI handle; unused (all commands
 *                   answer synchronously) and may be NULL.
 * @return           a pkg-allocated mi_response_t; ownership transfers
 *                   to the MI core, which serializes and frees it
 *                   (free_mi_response).  NULL = allocation failure.
 *
 * Process/locking context: callable from whichever process runs the MI
 * core.  Unlike the registry MI, every handler here performs
 * SYNCHRONOUS broker I/O on the calling process' pool connection
 * (jsOpts.Wait-bounded) -- the MI call blocks for up to that timeout,
 * and broker-side errors come back as MI errors with the libnats
 * status text.  The mutating commands (create/delete/purge) are
 * cluster-administration surfaces: deletes and purges are permanent
 * and take effect broker-side immediately.
