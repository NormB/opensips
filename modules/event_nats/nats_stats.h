/*
 * nats_stats.h — NATS Statistics and MI Command Handlers
 *
 * Module:  event_nats
 *
 * Defines the shared-memory statistics structure for tracking NATS
 * connection state and publish metrics, plus MI (Management Interface)
 * command handlers for runtime introspection.
 *
 * Key types:
 *   nats_stats_t  — volatile counters in shared memory, updated by
 *                   all OpenSIPS worker processes
 *
 * MI commands:
 *   nats_status    — connection state and server info
 *   nats_stats     — publish/ack counters
 *   nats_reconnect — force a reconnection (drain + reconnect)

 * NATS statistics counters, allocated in OpenSIPS shared memory.
 *
 * Counters are C11 _Atomic with relaxed ordering.  Plain `volatile`
 * is not atomic on weakly-ordered architectures (e.g. aarch64) and
 * concurrent increments produce torn writes (we measured a ~6x
 * undercount under N=8 threads).  The two hot counters (published,
 * failed) are cache-line aligned so per-worker increments do not
 * thrash a shared 64-byte line shared with cooler counters.
 *
 * NOTE: The `connected` field below is no longer read or written
 * anywhere; the canonical connection-status accessor is
 * nats_pool_is_connected() in lib/nats.  Field retained for ABI
 * compatibility; consider removing in a future cleanup.

/* Per-process upper bound for the SHM stats table.
 *
 * Allocated once in mod_init (pre-fork), sized once and forever.
 * 512 slots × 64 bytes each = 32 KB total — trivial SHM cost in
 * exchange for keeping every worker's counter increments on its
 * own cacheline.
 *
 * If a deployment ever runs more than 512 OpenSIPS processes,
 * bumps from process_no >= NATS_STATS_MAX_PROCS are silently
 * dropped (guarded in the bump path); the MI sum still iterates
 * the full table.  Bump the cap if that ceiling becomes a real
 * constraint. */

/* Per-process counter slot, indexed by process_no.  Most counters have
 * a single writer (the owning OpenSIPS process), but that is NOT true
 * for the JetStream ack counters (js_ack_ok / js_ack_failed): the
 * cnats AckHandler runs on a libnats internal thread that shares the
 * owning process's process_no, so it writes the SAME slot the OpenSIPS
 * main thread writes published/evi_published into — two concurrent
 * writers per slot.  All counters are therefore `_Atomic` and bumped
 * with atomic_fetch_add (NATS_STATS_BUMP); do NOT downgrade them to
 * plain increments on the assumption of a single writer.  MI reads use
 * relaxed atomic loads to avoid torn reads.
 *
 * One cacheline per slot keeps the bump path off any other
 * worker's hot lines. */
