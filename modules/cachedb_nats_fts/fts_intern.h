/*
 * cachedb_nats_intern -- refcounted SHM string intern table
 *
 * Why this exists.  At 100k AoRs / 2000 RPS the watcher's
 * nats_json_index_add hot path was spending ~half of all opensips
 * CPU in sem_wait -> hp_shm_malloc paths (design-repo PERF_NOTES.md).
 * Each indexed field on a usrloc contact triggers _entry_add_key
 * -> shm_malloc(klen+1) for a duplicate of the document key,
 * which then takes a per-bucket SHM_LOCK semaphore inside
 * HP_MALLOC.  ~5 indexed fields per contact x 2000 events/s =
 * ~10k shm_mallocs/s of small strings, all on the same hot path.
 *
 * Insight: the document key is the same string across ALL
 * field-entries for a given AoR.  Today we strdup it 5 times.
 * Interning the doc key collapses those 5 strdups into 1
 * lookup-or-allocate-once, and on every subsequent re-register
 * of the same AoR (the dominant workload) the lookup hits an
 * existing entry and does NO shm_malloc at all.
 *
 * The intern table is a sharded hash table: 1024 buckets,
 * 32 lock shards.  Refcounts are bumped on acquire and
 * decremented on release; the entry is freed when the count
 * reaches zero.  Lookups under the shard lock; the shard lock
 * is independent of the index shard lock so there's no
 * deadlock with cachedb_nats_json's per-shard scheme (the
 * index lock is always taken first; intern lock is always
 * taken second; never the other way around).
 *
 * Memory: each intern node is sizeof(nats_intern_node_t) +
 * len + 1, allocated with a single shm_malloc.  At steady
 * state with 100k AoRs and ~30-byte doc keys, the intern
 * table holds 100k entries x ~70 bytes each = ~7 MB SHM --
 * trivial.
 *
 * Lifetime: nodes are kept in SHM until refcount hits zero,
 * which happens when the last index entry that referenced
 * the doc key is freed (typically via _entry_remove_key when
 * an AoR de-registers, or _free_entry on full index destroy).
 *
 * Thread safety: every operation locks the relevant shard.
 * Multi-process safe: the table lives in SHM, the locks are
 * gen_lock_set_t (POSIX-sem on aarch64), so the dedicated
 * watcher proc and the rank-1 pthread are equally well
 * supported.
