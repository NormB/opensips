/*
 * cachedb_nats_json.h — JSON Document Search Index for NATS KV
 *
 * Module:  cachedb_nats
 *
 * Implements a process-local, hash-based search index over JSON documents
 * stored in a NATS JetStream KV bucket.  The index maps field:value pairs
 * to sets of document keys, enabling efficient cachedb query() operations
 * (SQL-like WHERE clauses) without scanning all keys.
 *
 * The index is populated at startup by scanning the KV bucket, and kept
 * in sync via a NATS KV watcher that receives real-time updates on a
 * background thread.  Access is protected by a sharded SHM lock set.
 *
 * Key types:
 *   nats_idx_entry   — one hash bucket entry mapping a "field:value" to keys
 *   nats_search_idx  — the hash table with mutex protection
 *
 * Key constants:
 *   nats_idx_buckets — runtime hash bucket count (default 4096,
 *                       set by the `index_buckets` modparam)
 *
 * Thread safety:
 *   All index operations (add, remove, query, rebuild) acquire the
 *   nats_search_idx.shard_locks (a SHM-backed gen_lock_set_t): whole-
 *   index ops take all shards, single-field ops take only the owning
 *   shard.  The KV watcher thread calls nats_json_index_add() and
 *   nats_json_index_remove() as documents change, while OpenSIPS worker
 *   processes call nats_cache_query() and nats_cache_update() from
 *   routing scripts.  The shard locks ensure mutual exclusion between
 *   these concurrent accesses.
