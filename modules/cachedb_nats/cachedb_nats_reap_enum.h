 * cachedb_nats_reap_enum.h -- one value-carrying watch pass over the
 * KV bucket, for the reaper.
 *
 * Why this exists: the reaper tick used to enumerate with
 * kvStore_Keys() (MetaOnly) and then re-fetch EVERY key's value with
 * an individual synchronous kvStore_Get() -- O(bucket) broker round
 * trips per tick.  Measured on the 30k-AoR bench (2026-07-07): the
 * per-key GET storm runs ~7-17 s per pass at ~1.6k req/s alongside
 * live traffic and drives REGISTER p99/max from ~1 ms to 27-88 ms
 * while it lasts.  A single WatchAll pass carries the values with it
 * (entry = key + value + revision), so the whole enumeration is one
 * ordered-consumer drain: no per-key round trips at all.
